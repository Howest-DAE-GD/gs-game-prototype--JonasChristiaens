Gameplay Scripting - Game Prototype: BallMuncher
- by Jonas Christiaens

2 words: Decay & Consumption
--------------------------------------------

Main gameplay of the game:
You are a ball. You will continiously shrink once you have shrunk to a certain size, you die. In order to stay alive you must consume other balls. 

These balls, in combination with some obstacles, will randomly spawn throughout the playing field. They will disappear after a couple of seconds (the later in the game/the higher your score, the faster they will disappear).
The obstacles and "food" will have different colors in order for the user to distinguish them between each other.
